# -HeartIQ-Disease-Analysis-Dashboard-4th-year-project-part-1
The Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard is a web-based tool that analyzes patient health data (like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.) to detect risk patterns and predict the likelihood of heart disease using data visualization and analytics.
🪜 Step-by-Step Development Plan

Collect dataset (UCI or Kaggle Heart Disease dataset).

Preprocess data using Python (Pandas, NumPy).

Analyze correlations (e.g., cholesterol vs. age vs. heart disease).

Train ML model for heart disease prediction.

Build frontend dashboard (HTML/CSS/JS).

Integrate backend (Flask or API to handle model).

Add charts (Chart.js or Plotly).

Test with sample data.

Deploy (on GitHub Pages or Streamlit Cloud).

Export reports (PDF summary of analysis).

🧾 Example Output

Input:
Age = 58, Cholesterol = 250, Blood Pressure = 145

Output:
Risk Level: High
Recommendation: “Consult a cardiologist; reduce salt intake, exercise regularly.”
